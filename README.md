This is a fork of the New Tab Page from Kiwi Browser, open-source and free to use in non-commercial projects.


The New Tab Page is in two parts:
 - A list of most visited websites, ordered on a grid of tiles
 - A list of recent news


The main concept behind this New Tab Page is that a tile grid of the most visited websites is displayed on screen.
The resulting HTML is stored in a local cache (localStorage.cachedGrid).

Once the page is loaded, the pre-rendered version of the tile grid (localStorage.cachedGrid) is instantly displayed on screen (fake-bookmarks-grid) and then swapped with a dynamic / customizable grid rendered in JS (that supports drag and drop).


The list of tiles to be displayed is provided by an internal API: chrome.embeddedSearch.newTabPage.mostVisited (the most visited websites by the user).

If the user has manually added a website (or moved one of the tile), the list is provided by localStorage.storedItems instead of newTabPage.mostVisited.

If you need favicons, you can grab them from:
 - local: chrome-search://favicon or chrome-search://ntpicon/size/24@2x/https://cnn.com (local favicons)
or
 - from Google's server (https://s2.googleusercontent.com/s2/favicons?domain_url=cnn.com&alt=404&sz=32 - T&C of Google applies)
or
 - from Kiwi Browser's server (https://logos.kiwibrowser.com/cnn.com - No analytics, no logs, no identifier to send).

For security reasons, the new tab page should only establish connection to HTTPS servers.
CORS (loading requests from remote servers), XHR and CSP policies can be adapted if you need, feel free to ask on Discord (or open an issue).

You can directly test and develop the new tab page online by going with your favorite browser (Chrome or Kiwi Browser) on https://kiwibrowser.github.io/ntp/local_ntp.html (or on your own copy, by forking the repository or self-hosting the html file).

Have fun,
Arnaud.
